                    <p>I'm an anthropologist, a designer, former entrepreneur, and at present, enjoying the puzzles of being a data and social scientist. 
                        I find abstractions and poetics more interesting than narratives. I'm humbled by how the environments we create in turn shape our beliefs, gestures, and relationships. 
                        How we're still the same cave-dwellers we once were. Thousands of years on we're still looking at dots, drawing constellations to read the future. 
                        Except now in place of saber-tooth tigers, our threats are invisible. My top 3 invisible problems to work on in the next few years are puzzles related to information asymmetry, structural inequalities, and the climate crisis.
                        Occasionally a person comes along and asks: what's that!? I hear you, these are big abstracted words. Big words make problems loom bigger... foggier. 
                        
                        I'm noodling on recommender systems, digital civic society, behavioural signals... ways to think about us, humans, with our messy, leaky bodies in space, and how that might relate to our presence (or representations) in the digital world.
                        I believe that we're living in unprecedented times. Not without historical parallels. But strange, new times. And I'm excited to see where we go. 
                        I believe in spite / despite the ease of creating nowadays, I'm still drawn to creating: art, aesthetics, design... whatever word we use to describe "things" of lesser chaos.
                        If only to discover some morsel of truth in beauty, in the limits of my own beliefs, or surrender to mystery.
