                    <p> I'm a data and social scientist. I'm also an anthropologist, an artist / designer, and a former entrepreneur. As a student of human behaviours, I'm humbled by how plastic and persistent humans are. 
                        How environments we create can easily and quickly, shape our thoughts, beliefs, gestures, and relationships. I believe we're still the cave-dwellers we once were. Thousands of years on, we're still gazing at dots in the distance, drawing constellations to read the future. 
                        Except now in place of fanged tigers, our threats are invisible, imperceptible,and immediate. If I had to pick my top 3 puzzles to noodle on in the next few years are puzzles related to information asymmetry, structural inequalities, and the climate crisis.
                        I'm noodling on recommender systems, digital civic society, behavioural signals... ways to think about thoughts, texts, tokens, traces, and tools.  Occasionally a person comes along and asks: what's that?! I hear you. These are big abstracted words. Big words make problems loom bigger, foggier. 
                        Isn't it incredible how with our messy, leaky, material bodies in space, we have somehow created presence in the electronic world? In these strange, unprecedented times, I'm excited to see where we go. 
                        When it's this easy to simulate thought, I believe in doubling down on making art...or whichever word you and I use to describe "things" of lesser chaos...if only to discover a morsel of truth in beauty, in the limits of my own fallible beliefs, or surrender completely to mystery.
